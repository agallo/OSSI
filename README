This script takes in a file of extensions (single extension per line) and
creates an ooutput file that can be pasted into an Avaya Communications
Manager (CM) terminal when set to terminal type = OSSI.

Optional command line flags are:
    -i, --infile    file containing list of extensions
    -o, --outfile   name of the output file to write the OSSI script to
    -c, --checktype the type of sanity checking to be done on the input file

The default input file is extfile.  The default output file is extfile.OSSI
The default sanity checking is 'strict'.  Any other value for this parameter
will result in 'loose' checking

Strict checking will examine the file and count the number of lines that do NOT
contain integer values.  NO output file will be created.

Loose sanity checking will attempt to process the file by skipping lines with errors.

Sanity checking only checks that each line contains integers.  There is no checking
for dial plan conformity.


OSSI is a hidden terminal type available when logging in via the SAT.
